On-chain social experiment inspired by the Spanish film “The Platform” (El Hoyo).
In the film, participants are distributed across different floors, completely isolated from 
each other except for a hole in the center through which a platform carrying food descends. 
The platform only moves from top to bottom. Although there is enough food for everyone at the 
beginning, those on the upper floors overconsume or hoard it, leaving little or nothing for 
those below. Being assigned to a lower level can therefore mean death. Each month, after the platform 
has passed through all floors, participants are randomly reassigned.

This contract aims to replicate that same logic. There are 10 floors where players are located, and a 
platform that descends carrying a cryptocurrency representing food. When the platform reaches a player’s 
floor, participants can take as many tokens as they want (the fastest players have priority), up to a
maximum of 1100 SurvivorCoins. This cap reflects the idea that no one can consume or hoard everything.
Without this restriction, a single participant could monopolize the supply, and the experiment would 
lose its purpose.

Once the platform completes its descent, participants holding fewer than 100 tokens die. Among the survivors,
100 tokens are consumed, along with 90% of their remaining balance. These tokens are returned to the platform. 
All surviving players receive an Ethereum reward (giving SurvivorCoin market value through its direct 
relationship with ETH) and are then reassigned to new floors.

To reduce bots and multi-account manipulation, participants must pay an entry fee in ETH, which is ten times 
higher than the per-round reward. This pool funds future rewards and includes a commission for the contract 
creator. As a result, a player must survive the first 10 rounds just to recover their initial investment. 
Beyond that point, they can theoretically generate unlimited real profit.

At first glance, the optimal strategy (Pareto optimum) appears to be cooperation: players simply take the 
minimum tokens required to survive, allowing everyone to benefit without risk. However, this is fundamentally
a zero-sum game, since the only income entering the pool is generated by the players themselves. It therefore 
becomes a highly competitive system where individuals indirectly compete to keep the contract solvent. The more 
players that are eliminated, the larger the rewards for survivors.

If the goal is not merely to create a survival casino but to model a true Prisoner’s Dilemma, a significant 
upfront stake is required. This ensures the experiment fulfills its purpose: to reveal whether participants 
sustain cooperation or converge to the Nash equilibrium implied by individual incentives. Rational agents may 
behave selfishly by hoarding extra tokens to create artificial scarcity and trade them within their floor, or 
by taking the maximum allowed amount to guarantee survival for one additional round.

The project is implemented using an ERC20 token based on the OpenZeppelin library, with modified transfer 
and transferFrom functions to restrict token transfers exclusively to alive participants located on the same floor.

All blockchain addresses start by default on floor 0, where they cannot interact with the contract unless they pay
the entry fee. Upon payment, they are moved to the waiting room (floor 12) and receive enough tokens to purchase 
their “life pass” at the end of the round.

To manage life and death status, the contract maintains a global variable representing the current round, along with
a mapping that tracks the last round for which each player has purchased their life pass. If a player does not renew 
their pass for the next round, they remain recorded in their last paid round and are therefore considered dead. New 
participants join at the current round.

The floor system and token distribution mechanism are implemented by using the contract’s own address as the descending
platform. Each day, the platform moves to a different floor, allowing sufficient time for players on that floor to claim 
their tokens. After visiting all active floors, the platform remains for one additional day on floor 11, during which 
surviving players may purchase their life pass for the next round. Once this period ends, a new round begins, the platform 
resets to floor 1, and the SurvivorCoin supply is reloaded.

When a player purchases a life pass for the next round, they receive their corresponding ETH reward and are pseudo-randomly
reassigned to either the same or a different floor.

To maximize fairness in floor reassignment and prevent centralized control, the pseudo-random seed is derived from the 
aggregate decisions made by participants during the round (specifically, the amounts of tokens claimed). While the final 
actor could theoretically influence the distribution, doing so requires extreme strategic positioning, such as attempting
to monopolize the remaining tokens to ensure being the last mover, which significantly constrains practical manipulation.
